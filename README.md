# Frontier Systems Lab

This repository documents my structured journey to becoming a frontier-level AI systems architect.

The focus is not model hype.
The focus is operational intelligence: training, inference, data pipelines, evaluation, safety, and governance.

Each folder represents a systems layer.
Each commit represents a shipped learning artefact.

## 📐 Lab Philosophy

This lab is structured around one core principle:

> AI is not just models — it is infrastructure, data systems, evaluation loops, safety controls, and governance architecture.

Each module builds upward from first principles toward production-grade system design.

## 00 — Foundations

Core mathematical and engineering prerequisites.

* Linear algebra refresh
* Optimisation fundamentals
* PyTorch basics

Purpose:
Build the theoretical substrate required to reason about model behaviour and training dynamics.

---

## 01 — Data Pipelines

Data engineering for AI systems.

* Ingestion
* Cleaning
* Chunking
* Vectorisation
* Evaluation pipelines

Purpose:
Understand that model quality is downstream of data quality.

---

## 02 — RAG Systems

Retrieval-augmented generation architectures.

* Naive RAG
* Hybrid search
* Re-rankers
* Evaluation strategies

Purpose:
Design knowledge-grounded AI systems capable of reliable contextual reasoning.

---

## 03 — Training

Model training infrastructure and optimisation.

* LoRA fine-tuning
* Distributed training
* Logging & observability
* Failure recovery

Purpose:
Operate and debug model training at scale.

---

## 04 — Inference

Serving and production optimisation.

* Batching
* Caching
* Guardrails
* Triton-based serving

Purpose:
Deliver low-latency, cost-efficient, production-grade inference systems.

---

## 05 — Safety

AI system robustness and adversarial defence.

* Prompt injection mitigation
* Red teaming
* Sandboxing
* Audit logs

Purpose:
Build systems resilient to misuse and adversarial manipulation.

---

## 06 — Evaluations

Measurement and regression control.

* Benchmarks
* Evaluation harness
* Regression testing

Purpose:
Establish empirical control loops over system performance.

---

## 07 — Governance

Operational and compliance controls.

* Policy engines
* Kill switch mechanisms
* Rate limiting
* Compliance structures

Purpose:
Treat AI as critical infrastructure requiring oversight and control mechanisms.

---

## 08 — Case Studies

Applied system builds.

* Black Ice style architecture study
* RWA platform system analysis

Purpose:
Translate theory into integrated system designs.

# How To Use This Lab

You can approach this repository in one of three modes:

### 1. Sequential Mastery

Start at `00-foundations` and move upward.

### 2. Domain Deep Dive

Jump directly into a vertical (e.g., RAG, Safety, Governance).

### 3. Systems Integration

Use case studies to connect multiple modules into a coherent architecture.

# Long-Term Goal

To develop the ability to:

* Design sovereign AI systems
* Evaluate external AI vendors rigorously
* Build production-grade AI infrastructure
* Implement safety and governance by design
